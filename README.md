# 7GUIs Programming Benchmark Challenge

The <a target="_blank" rel="noopenner noreferrer" href="https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/">7GUIs (Graphical User Interfaces) programming benchmark</a> is a useful way to sharpen and showcase your frontend development skills.

I'm choosing to work directly with HTML, CSS, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopenner noreferrer" href="http://vanilla-js.com/">Vanilla JavaScript</a>. But there are no restrictions on using frameworks / libraries to complete the 7GUIs.

## Development

To get this project running on your local machine, you will need to clone this repository and start a server pointing at the `site` folder. I've chosen to use `browser-sync` to handle this for me. If you have NodeJS on your system, after cloning and changing into the directory, run `npm i` and then `npm start`.
